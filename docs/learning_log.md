Day 0 - Enviroment setup complete. Ready to start Week 1 tomorrow.
Day 1 - Python reboot and enviroment confidence. Wrote and ran python code, refreshed core syntax, completed 5 warm up excercises, learned basic debugging, logged learning. Completed the python basics section of the python certificate in freeCodeCamp.
Day 2 - Functions, File I/O, and Debugging. Did a warm up excercise and worked on created a few functions that opened, read, and counted lines in a file. Watched a short view on file handing on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfaWl-aWxfc to help. Debugged a small function.
Day 3 - Logic, Lists and DSA Warm-Up. Worked on learning lists and loop patterns, a and did some dsa warmup excerises for things like getting the largetst number in a list, getting a new list with the even numbers, counting how many times a value appears, reverse a list, and check if a list is sorted. I watched a tutorial on loops and aptters on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHA53-05510 to help. then I debugged a small function. Everything was pretty easy and a good review.
Day 4 - Problem Solvinf Patterns and Intermediate DSA. First did reseach on the Accumulator Pattern, Two-pointer Pattern, and Sliding Window Pattern. Watched this youtube video on two-pointer patter:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzZ7nmouLTI for help. Watched this youtube video on leetcode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHZW7TuY_yo to help. small debug problem
Day 5 - Intermediate DSA and Real Problem Solving. Read articles on hash table, hash set, frequency counting pattern. small debug and practice problems.
Day 6 - Strings, Searching, and Clean Abstractions. First watched some videos on Frequency Counting for Strings, Two-pointer String Scanning, and SLiding Window for Strings. Did a few dsa problems and a debugging challenge. 
Day 7 - Searching, Sorting, and into to Recursion. Started with watching some videos on binary search and the visual expinations helped with trying to imagine the application. Then worked on some dsa problems with binary search and recursion.
Day 8 - Data Structures: Stacks, Queues and sets. Watched some quick vidoes of stacks and queues explained: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3ZUpyrnCbM to help. Watched a video on when to use sets in algorithms https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvvvGT3qD1Y to help. Did some dsa practice problems utilizing stacks, queues and sets. I found the initial idea of parenthesis balancing confusing but once i got more clarification the implementation made sense. Also completed a debugging challenge.
